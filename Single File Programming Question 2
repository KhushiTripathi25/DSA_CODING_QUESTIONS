Problem Statement: An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:
  1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler) = V
  2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
  The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.

Example:
Input:
  200 -> Value of V
  540 -> Value of W
Output:
  TW =130 FW=70
Explanation:
  130+70 = 200 vehicles
  (70*4) + (130*2) = 540 wheels
Input format : The input consists of two positive integers separated by a new line, representing the total number of vehicles (V) and the total number of wheels (W).
Output format : The output prints two integers separated by a space, representing the number of two-wheelers (TW) and four-wheelers (FW) to manufacture. Print "INVALID INPUT" if the inputs do not meet the constraints.
Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
Code constraints :
  20 ≤ V ≤ 109
  50 ≤ W ≤ 109
  W % 2 = 0
  V < W

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
  200
  540
Output 1 :
  TW= 130 FW= 70

Input 2 :
  2000
  100
Output 2 :
  INVALID INPUT

CPP CODE:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int v = 200;
	int w = 540;
	if(v < 20 || v > 1e9 || w < 50 || w > 1e9 || w % 2 != 0 ||v >=w){
		cout<<"INVALID INPUT"<<endl;
		return 0;
	}
	int FW = (w-2*v)/2;
	int TW = v - FW;
	if(FW >= 0 && TW >= 0){
		cout<<"TW="<<TW<<"FW="<<FW<<endl;
	}else{
		cout<<"INVALID INPUT"<<endl;
	}return 0;
}
